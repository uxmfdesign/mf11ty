This theme uses 11ty's [Syntax Highlighting Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/), a pack of Eleventy plugins for PrismJS syntax highlighting. No browser/client JavaScript, highlight transformations are all done at build-time.

```js
function myFunction() {
  return true;
}
```
